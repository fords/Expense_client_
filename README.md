# Expense Split Full Stack Project

Inspired by Splitwise app created in Rhode Island, the app that keeps track of bills split among friends and family,I created the Expense Split Track full stack project using single page application Ember and Express framework. The app has the option of adding person's name and creating expense that could be split among the people. The expense could be apartment utilities, hotel stay, trips cost, events tickets cost or any events. The expense has the total amount and people's name list. You can sign up and sign in using any dummy email address even such as 1@1.1 and any password. </br>

 <strong>Note that since Database is stored in free version of Heroku, sign up and sign in action can take up to 10 seconds. Please be patient when the request is waking up server.</strong>
